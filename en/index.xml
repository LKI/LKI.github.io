      <description>Today I watched an inspiring video about Dream
 Video is here on youtube.
It&amp;rsquo;s really inspiring. Especially on the long hot summer night :)
Go watch it. You will get inspired up too.
And the lines is as below:
 I don’t know what that dream is that you have. I don’t care how disappointing it might have been, as you’ve been working toward that dream. But that dream your holding in your mind that it’s possible that some of you already know that it’s hard.</description>

      <description>A trick in Ubuntu.
 x package can be updated Recently I get this message when log into the system.
 x packages can be updated. y updates are security updates.  Ummm, the &amp;ldquo;You have X app to update&amp;rdquo; hint.
It should be done with this command I think:
 apt-get update apt-get upgrade  But seems this update&amp;amp;&amp;amp;upgrade command does nothing:
 x packages can be updated. y updates are security updates.</description>

      <description>Today I encounter a problem running vagrant up：
 ==&amp;gt; cvc-tools: Machine booted and ready! ==&amp;gt; cvc-tools: Checking for guest additions in VM... ==&amp;gt; cvc-tools: Configuring and enabling network interfaces... ==&amp;gt; cvc-tools: Mounting shared folders... cvc-tools: /work =&amp;gt; D:/work/ Failed to mount folders in Linux guest. This is usually because the &amp;quot;vboxsf&amp;quot; file system is not available. Please verify that the guest additions are properly installed in the guest and can work properly.</description>
